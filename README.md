Remember!
- Our SDKs are WeMos D1 Mini flashing compatible
- Set the BOARD to ESP32 DEV Module (or similar).
- You can also set the BAUD rate to 921600 to speed up flashing.
- The SDK does NOT need external power to flash.  It will take Power from the USB 5V.
*You may though need to provide external DC for power up all the SDK functions.*

The purpose of our test code is to cycle through the various main functions of the board as part of bring up testing.

All test code is OPEN SOURCE and although is is not intended for real world use, it may be freely used, or modified as needed.  It is distributed on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.
